EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

Product: Nimbus Note - A visual writing platform that combines focused prose creation with infinite canvas organization and AI-powered story development assistance.

Target Launch: MVP in 6-8 months, full platform in 12-15 months
Business Model: $10/month subscription with 250,000 AI credits included
Primary Users: Novelists (ICP), with secondary support for screenwriters and game writers

PROBLEM STATEMENT
================

Visual-thinking writers struggle with traditional linear writing tools that don't support spatial organization of story elements. Current solutions either focus on pure writing (Google Docs, Scrivener) or pure visual organization (Milanote, Miro) but don't integrate both with AI assistance for creative development. Writers need a unified platform that lets them:

- Visually map relationships between characters, plot points, and world-building elements
- Seamlessly transition between focused writing and visual brainstorming
- Get AI assistance for plot holes and character development without over-reliance
- Import existing work from Notion and Word documents
- Collaborate with beta readers and editors with appropriate permissions

TARGET AUDIENCE
===============

Primary (ICP): Novelists
- Genre fiction writers (fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, romance)
- Visual thinkers who benefit from spatial organization
- Writers with existing work in Notion or Word docs
- Authors seeking AI assistance for creative enhancement

Secondary: Screenwriters & Game Writers
- Screenwriters plotting visual scenes and character arcs
- Game writers developing narrative branches and world-building
- Anyone creating complex fictional universes with interconnected elements
