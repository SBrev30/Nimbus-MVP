## Integration with Existing System

### 1. Update Main App Component

Replace the existing Canvas import in your main app:

```tsx
// In src/App.tsx or wherever Canvas is imported
import Canvas from './components/EnhancedCanvas'; // Instead of './components/Canvas'
```

### 2. Database Migration

Run the SQL schema in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Execute the contents of src/sql/master-canvas-schema.sql
-- This will add the necessary tables for Master Canvas functionality
```

### 3. Update Package Dependencies

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "reactflow": "^11.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.1",
    "uuid": "^9.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/uuid": "^9.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Add any necessary environment variables for AI services:

```env
# Add to your .env file
VITE_AI_SERVICE_URL=your-ai-service-endpoint
VITE_AI_API_KEY=your-ai-api-key
```

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Dual Canvas System
- **Master Mode**: Auto-populated from project data with AI analysis

- **Seamless Switching**: Toggle between modes with preserved state

### âœ… Project Integration
- **Auto-Population**: Canvas generated from existing project chapters and characters
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in project data automatically refresh canvas
- **Smart Positioning**: Intelligent node placement based on story structure

### âœ… AI-Powered Analysis
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies plot holes, character inconsistencies, timeline issues
- **Severity Levels**: High, medium, low priority conflicts with confidence scores
- **Character Arc Analysis**: Tracks character development and completeness
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for story improvement

### âœ… Chapter Node System
- **Detailed Information**: Chapter title, word count, status, characters
- **Conflict Indicators**: Visual badges showing number of detected issues
- **Interactive Details**: Modal with comprehensive chapter information
- **Navigation**: Easy movement between chapters

### âœ… Enhanced User Experience
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during canvas generation
- **Mode-Specific UI**: Different toolbar options for Master vs Exploratory
- **Analysis Summary**: Real-time display of story health metrics
- **Conflict Management**: Ability to dismiss conflicts and provide feedback

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Next Steps)

### 1. Enhanced AI Integration
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of story changes
- **Advanced Algorithms**: More sophisticated plot hole detection
- **Genre-Specific Rules**: Analysis tailored to story genres
