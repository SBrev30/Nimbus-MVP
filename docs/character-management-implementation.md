# Character Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds full character management functionality to the Nimbus MVP, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete characters for their writing projects.

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`src/services/character-service.ts`** - Service layer for character CRUD operations
2. **`src/components/planning/character-creation-modal.tsx`** - Modal component for creating new characters

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/components/planning/CharactersPage.tsx`** - Updated to be fully functional with database integration

## Database Schema
The existing `characters` table was updated with the following structure:

```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- project_id (UUID, nullable) - Links to projects table
- user_id (UUID, required) - Links to auth.users
- name (TEXT, required) - Character name
- role (TEXT, required) - protagonist|antagonist|supporting|minor
- description (TEXT, required) - Character description
- background (TEXT, nullable) - Character backstory
- traits (TEXT[], nullable) - Array of personality traits
- physical_description (TEXT, nullable) - Physical appearance
- age (INTEGER, nullable) - Character age
- occupation (TEXT, nullable) - Character job/profession
- completeness_score (INTEGER, 0-100) - Auto-calculated completion percentage
- tags (TEXT[], nullable) - Organization tags
- character_data (JSONB, nullable) - Additional structured data
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Auto-managed
- updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Auto-managed with trigger
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Character Creation
- Comprehensive character creation modal with form validation
- Support for basic info (name, role, description)
- Extended info (background, physical description, age, occupation)
- Dynamic traits and tags system
- Auto-calculated completeness score

### 2. Character Management
- Load characters from database
- Real-time search across name, description, and background
- Filter by character role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, minor)
- Delete characters with confirmation
- View character details

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements
- Loading states during data fetching
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Empty states with helpful tips
- Responsive grid layout for character cards
- Role-based color coding
- Completeness progress indicators
- Hover actions for quick access to edit/delete

### 4. Database Integration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data isolation
- Proper indexes for performance
- Automatic timestamp management
- Soft validation with database constraints

## Character Service API

```typescript
// Get all characters (optionally filtered by project)
characterService.getCharacters(projectId?: string): Promise<Character[]>

// Get specific character by ID
characterService.getCharacter(id: string): Promise<Character | null>

// Create new character
characterService.createCharacter(data: CreateCharacterData): Promise<Character>

// Update existing character
characterService.updateCharacter(id: string, updates: UpdateCharacterData): Promise<Character>

// Delete character
characterService.deleteCharacter(id: string): Promise<void>

// Search characters by text
characterService.searchCharacters(query: string, projectId?: string): Promise<Character[]>

// Get characters by role
characterService.getCharactersByRole(role: string, projectId?: string): Promise<Character[]>
```

## Completeness Score Calculation
The system automatically calculates a completeness score (0-100%) based on:
- **Basic Info (40%)**: Name (15%), Description (15%), Role (10%)
- **Extended Info (40%)**: Background (20%), Traits (20%)
- **Organization (20%)**: Tags (20%)

## Security
- All database operations are protected by Row Level Security
- Users can only access their own characters
- Project-based access control for shared characters
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance
- Indexed queries for fast filtering and searching
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Minimal database round trips

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- Character editing modal (currently TODO)
- Character detail view/modal
- Character relationships management
- Character arc tracking
- Export functionality
- Character templates
- AI-assisted character generation

## Usage
The Characters page can be accessed from the Planning dropdown menu. Users can:
1. Click "Create First Character" when no characters exist
2. Use "New Character" button when characters already exist
3. Search and filter existing characters
4. Click on character cards to view details
5. Use hover actions to edit or delete characters

## Error Handling
- Network errors show retry options
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Database errors are logged and display user-friendly messages
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
